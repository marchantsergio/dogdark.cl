     --------------------
      Sound-Tracker 3.0: 
     --------------------

- a *.MD8 player by Our 5oft, taken
  from the Intel Outside Demo (PD);
- supports any 64k XL/XE Atari and
  uses up to 48k RAM for *.MD8 files;
- alas, the program is Reset-proof,
  thus power-off to quit the program;

Key commands:
*************

- first press SPACE for a DIR of #1;
- next use +* to choose a *.MD8 file;
- then press RETURN to load the file;
- finally press SPACE to playback;
- press SHIFT to stop playing;
- press ESC for a restart/new dir.;
- start over again with Space key...

That's all. Of course not all *.MD8
files will fit into 64k memory. Thus
use an XE-MD8-Player for more RAM...
