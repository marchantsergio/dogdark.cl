      XE-MD8-Player: 
     ----------------

- another *.MD8 player from Poland;
- supports 64k and 128k Ataris and
  up to 16k+64k RAM for *.MD8 files;
- just press RESET at any time to
  quit the program (coldstart);

Key commands:
*************

- first press SPACE for a DIR of #1;
- next use +* to choose a *.MD8 file;
- then press RETURN to load the file;
- finally press SPACE to playback;
- press SHIFT to stop playing;
- press ESC for a restart/new dir.;
- start over again with Space key...

That's all. Since this is an older
version of a *.MD8 player, it cannot
playback all MD8-files, sorry...
